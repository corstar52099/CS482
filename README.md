# CS482
Artificial intelligence 


This project uses the Minimax algorithm to implement a smart tictactoe AI player
The program is currently designed to only run for one singular turn for a predetermined game state. 
That game state is a txt file contained within the SRC directory. The game state has a specific format
exemplified in test.txt. There is a makefile in the Build directory that can be used to compile the code within 
the entire project(src and include). The build of the makefile ends up in the Build directory as tictactoe.exe
